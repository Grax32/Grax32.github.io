### [Opinions](/here/is/my/opinion)

* [Orlando's Melrose Technology Center Rocks](/2014/04/orlandos-melrose-technology-center-rocks.html)
  * The public library in Orlando has an amazing facility for Makers of many varieties.  Individual Audio/Video, group Audio/Video, 3D printing, meeting places, and classes are all available.
* [Female Code Camp Speakers](/2014/03/female-code-camp-speakers.html)
  * It is upsetting when technical events seem to be excluding people based on non-technical criteria such as gender, race, sexual orientation, etc.  However; it is unfair to rant, point fingers, or call names without giving the organizers a fair chance to correct things.
