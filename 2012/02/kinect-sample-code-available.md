# Grax Coding: Kinect sample code available

Here is the code the goes along with my January 25 presentation titled "Augmented Reality with the Kinect" at the Lincoln .NET Users Group.

Remember to check the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/">Kinect for Windows</a> site to verify you have all of the system requirements.

To get started with basic Kinect for Windows coding, I recommend Microsoft's Skeleton Sample.

The Kinect with WPF (Video Magic WPF) sample code from my presentation is available for download at <a href="http://graxark.codeplex.com/releases/view/81378">http://graxark.codeplex.com/releases/view/81378</a>.

The Kinect with XNA sample code will be posted soon.  I am doing a bit of cleanup to remove unused code and such before posting.

Feel free to ask questions.  I will answer them if I can.
