### Opinions

* [Female Code Camp Speakers](/)
  * It is upsetting when technical events seem to be excluding people based on non-technical criteria such as gender, race, sexual orientation, etc.  However; it is unfair to rant, point fingers, or call names without giving the organizers a fair chance to correct things.
* [The Computer Doesn't Know You're Gay](/)
  * The computer works or doesn't work based on the inputs it is given.  It has no bias for or against anyone.
