title: Buying and Updating My New Surface RT Tablet
---
<div>
This has been a great year for me for getting new or updated electronic devices. &nbsp;When I saw the Black Friday special for the $199 Surface RT 32GB, I decided it was time to buy.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Black Friday Online Madness</b></div>
<div>
I started trying to order at 11 PM my time, when the special started. &nbsp;3 hours later and a wonderful hint on Twitter that the mobile site wasn't having the same issues, and I had my order placed. &nbsp; The 3 hours was spent trying to order via the web site. &nbsp;It only took me 2 minutes to order on the mobile site.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I found Microsoft's mobile store to be very nice and easy to use. &nbsp;I was accessing it from a Windows Phone but I would assume it would work just as well from another smart phone.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Fast-forward one week and my surface arrived in its shiny black and white box. &nbsp;I was a little disappointed when I opened it to find the packing material completely flat, allowing it to move around some but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from that. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I opened the box and immediately tried to power on the device but nothing happened. &nbsp;I plugged it in and tried again and everything works. &nbsp;Apparently it (or at least mine) arrives with no battery charge.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>0x800b0101 means your clock is wrong in Microsoft language</b></div>
<div>
I tried to go through setup and add my Microsoft account but I got the very cryptic "0x800b0101" error. &nbsp;Thanks to <a href="http://windowsitpro.com/windows-81/one-fix-0x800b0101-error-when-setting-microsoft-account-new-surface">this blog post</a>, I decided to try setting the clock. &nbsp;To do that, swipe in from the right, type the word "date" (or "time") in the search box and hit the search button. &nbsp;Tap "Settings" below the search and you should see a "Set the time and date" in the middle of the screen. &nbsp;Click on that and change the time and time zone to your current time and time zone.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
That worked and after that change I could update to my Microsoft account.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Why the clock did not automatically update, I do not know. &nbsp;Windows 8 is configured by default to update its time from an internet time source, and I did have a good connection to the internet at this point. &nbsp;(For those of you interested in a technical explanation, my colleague is probably right when he ways "I'm guessing your time thing is related to how long your Surface sat in the box and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/05/10086404.aspx" target="_blank">this</a>.")</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I wanted to make sure that I had all of the updates available for my new Surface. &nbsp;You could choose to be patient and wait for the updates to happen on their own, but I want everything to be updated. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Windows Updates</b></div>
<div>
App updates should come from the Store app and should appear when you open that app. &nbsp; Windows updates can be access by swiping in from the right, click "Settings", and then click "Change PC Settings". &nbsp;Windows Update is the bottom item on the list. &nbsp;By default it is set to automatically check for updates but I'm in a hurry so I click on the "Check for Updates" button. &nbsp;It looks for a bit and then tells me that there is a firmware update and that there are 37 updates. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Remember the part earlier where the battery isn't charged. &nbsp;I still have it plugged in but Windows Update wants more. &nbsp;The message that comes back is "Plug your PC into power, let it fully recharge, and try again."</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I checked back in 1 hour and it had apparently decided that I had enough battery power and gone ahead with the updates. &nbsp;At that point there was a message telling me that my computer would reboot in 1 day to complete the updates. &nbsp;I selected the option to restart immediately and finish updates. &nbsp;Now it tells me to keep the PC plugged in until this is done and it is installing updates.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
This takes a very long time. &nbsp;I started the process at 10:00 AM it saying "Installing 1 of 15". &nbsp;An hour later, it says "Installing 2 of 15". &nbsp;At 12:30 it says "Installing update 14 of 15", so now we're making some progress.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I ran some errands and checked again at 3:30 PM. &nbsp;Finally, it was all done with the updates.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Windows 8.1 Upgrade</b></div>
<div>
At this point I logged in and went to the Store app, where I found the Windows 8.1 upgrade waiting for me. &nbsp;I skipped the other app updates that it showed and I start the download on that (2.1 gigabytes) and it is time to take another break waiting for the download to complete. &nbsp;2 hours later (5:30 PM) and it appears to be done with the download portion and the first part of the install, as it says "Preparing to restart". &nbsp;A few minutes later it is saying that it is going to restart and that I should save any work. &nbsp;I select "Restart now" and wait some more.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Another 45 minutes (6:15 PM) and it finishes the update and asks me to accept the license agreement. &nbsp;I believe it said that if you don't accept it, it will undo the Windows 8.1 update, so make sure you click the right button at this step.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I opened up the store app and apparently, updating to Windows 8.1 also updated all of the apps, so everything is ready to go.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The "0x800b0101" error was very frustrating. &nbsp;I found the answer in a short time because of my experience but I couldn't imagine a regular joe finding the answer that quickly. &nbsp;It seems like there should be an error message indicating that the issue is with the date and time on the Surface. &nbsp;Also, there should be something in the setup that forces a time update from the internet, once the internet connection is available.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
It took a long time to get through all of the updates. &nbsp;I started opening the box at 9:00 AM and was finished with all of the updating by 6:15 PM. &nbsp;The time is reasonable when you consider that this device is a year old and these are all of the updates for that year. &nbsp;Future updates should not take nearly as long.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I am very happy with my new Surface RT. &nbsp;I like that it comes with Office 2013 RT, including Outlook 2013. &nbsp;I hope that everyone that gets one this Christmas enjoys it as much as I do.</div>
