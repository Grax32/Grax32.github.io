Last night I gave a presentation about C# generics to the Lincoln .NET user's group. &nbsp;If you were there and want to see the code or if you weren't there and just want to see some interesting generic code, check out this source code. &nbsp;You will want to start by looking at the unit tests project, as that is where I ran all of the demonstrations from.<br />
<br />
My code from last night's presentation is at&nbsp;<a href="http://sdrv.ms/11ESMSs">http://sdrv.ms/11ESMSs</a>. &nbsp;This is a Visual Studio 2012 project.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you that need a Visual Studio 2010 version of the generics sample code, this is from my Nebraska Code Camp presentation. &nbsp;It doesn't have a few of the things from my Lincoln .NET user's group presentation but hopefully still interesting. You can download the Visual Studio 2010 project from&nbsp;<a href="http://sdrv.ms/15hAXYZ">http://sdrv.ms/15hAXYZ</a><br />
