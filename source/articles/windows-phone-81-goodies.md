Two of my favorite features in Windows Phone 8.1 are the hands-free texting and the Word Flow Keyboard.<br />
<br />
With hands-free texting, I can reply to an incoming text without touching or looking at my phone. &nbsp;I can send a new text by pressing two buttons and then not touching or looking at the phone after that. &nbsp;This is great for when I am driving or working on a project like assembling a bookshelf or cooking.<br />

<br />
The Word Flow Keyboard allows me to enter long properly spelled words with a few swipes on the keyboard. &nbsp;If two words have similar swipe patterns, Windows Phone will select the one it deems the most likely match but the other possible matches are displayed and can be selected with a single tap.<br />
