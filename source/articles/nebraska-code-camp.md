Don't miss my Nebraska Code Camp session on Augmented Reality with Microsoft's Kinect for Windows.  I will be talking about the commercial API for the Kinect.  (The description was written before the commercial API was released)<br />
<br />
I will be presenting at 1:45 PM in the Twilio Room (Avery Hall rm 106).<br />
<br />
Code camp is a free community-driven developer conference.  It will be Saturday, March 10 at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.<br />
